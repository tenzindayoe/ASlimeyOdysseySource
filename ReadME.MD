Since my game contains paid assets and libraries from Unity, I could not upload all the source code needed for the game here.

Instead I added all the codes that I wrote with the help of AWS Q assistant here , which primarily was a flexible State machine that allowed me to scale the game very effectively and introduce new mechanics easily.

Another interesting feature that I developed  with AWS Q and also plan to publish in the Unity Asset Store is a Story Point system where we can define story points in a game. Unity currently does not have a framework 
like this that could help developers, and after my conversation with AWS Q we started coding this frame work together that is super flexible and works various elements and libraires of Unity to make a game story integrated in the code. 


If you would like to download an actual build of the game , you download the mac/windows build from my site soon :
